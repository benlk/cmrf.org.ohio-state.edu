                The Medieval and Renaissance Faire takes place on the South Oval 
                of the Ohio State University Columbus campus the first Saturday 
                in April. It has been going on in this area for over two decades 
                and will hopefully continue for years to come. The site is spotted 
                with trees native to central Ohio and also harbors the serene 
                Mirror Lake. With multiple paths and 4-5 performance sites each 
                year, this is the ideal location for the faire.</p>
