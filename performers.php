	<p>The Council hires outside performers to come to the Faire and perform for the patrons. It has had singers, musicians, sword fighters, comedy acts, stunt acts, and many more. Some of these performers are paid and some work for free. There are many performers that come directly from the Ohio State University, as well, including, but not limited to, the Medieval and Renaissance Performer's Guild, the Society for Creative Anachronism, the Arts and Sciences Student Council and the Pagan Student Association. </p>
	<p>The next Faire will be held in spring semester <?php echo $fair_year ; ?>, and will take place from 11 a.m. until 6 p.m. on the OSU South Oval.</p>
	<p>To apply to perform at Faire, please contact <a href="contact.php">our Performer Coordinator</a>.</p>
