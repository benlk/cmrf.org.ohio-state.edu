          The Council hires outside performers to come to the Faire and perform 
          for the patrons. It has had singers, musicians, sword fighters, comedy 
          acts, stunt acts, and many more. Some of these performers are paid and 
          some work for free. There are many performers that come directly from 
          the Ohio State University, as well, including, but not limited to, the 
          Medieval and Renaissance Performer's Guild, the Society for Creative 
          Anachronism, the Arts and Sciences Student Council and the Pagan Student 
          Association. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year, Faire will be held in spring semester 2013, and will take place from 11 a.m. until 6 p.m. on the 
          OSU Mirror Lake, and South Oval<br>
