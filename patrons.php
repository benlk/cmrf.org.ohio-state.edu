	  Each year, the Medieval and Renaissance Faire brings merriment and revelry to the South Oval of The Ohio State University. For more than 30 years, we've filled the South Oval with dancing and swordplay, merchants and minstrels, acrobats and storytellers. Admission is completely free, and it's always a wonderful way to spend a spring-time Saturday afternoon. So, grab a freshly roasted turkey leg, don your most dazzling noble garb, strap on your trusty sword, or simply throw on a T-shirt and jeans and come see what we're all about.

	  Admission is free.  The Faire will take place, rain or shine, in the humble, yet charming English village of Buck's Eye Hollow (also referred to as the South Oval of the Ohio State University). Daring duelists, talented musicians, and sundry acting troupes from throughout our great country have been assembled for your pleasure to perform their acts on more than seven stages across the grounds of the Faire. Additionally, a great number of fine merchants and craftsmen will also gather to the site, selling everything from weaponry  and handmade jewelry, to T-shirts and children's toys.

	<h3><font color="#8D0122">This Faire Was Brought to You By:</font></h3>
	<p>
	  Many different OSU departments and organizations are represented at the Medieval and Renaissance Faire (for instance, the Pagan Student Organization offers free tarot readings, and the Arts and Sciences Council runs demonstrations of Renaissance board games). However, there are two OSU student organizations that work together throughout the year to create the Faire. The Council for the Medieval and Renaissance Faire organizes and funds the Faire, and the Guild of Medieval and Renaissance Performers teaches students period dances, music, history, stage combat and improv theater, and prepares a number of performances for the Faire.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Both organizations also work frequently with the community. The Guild has done a number of performances for the Columbus public libraries, Columbus area Girl Scout troupes, the Buckeyethon charity dance marathon, and other community organizations across Columbus. The Council works with a number of Ohio historical societies and offers free information tables at the faire to university and community groups, such as the Santa Maria and the OSU Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies.
	</p>
	<p>
	  We are always happy to have new members and make new contacts, so if you are interested in becoming involved with the faire, feel free to contact us. The Council's website is: <a href="../index.html">http://cmrf.org.ohio-state.edu</a>, and the Guild's website is <a href="http://guild.org.ohio-state.edu">http://guild.org.ohio-state.edu</a>.
